## Running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Copy and populate `config.example.yaml` as `config.yaml` ([you'll need a valid `token`](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)) then: 

`python -m disco.cli`

Invoke your copy of Fluid by mentioning it. Using the prefix for some reason doesn't work.

- `@Fluid join`
- `@Fluid play yoga rebecca black`
- `@Fluid np`

## Dockering

Copy and populate `config.example.yaml` as `config.yaml` ([you'll need a valid `token`](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)) then: 

`docker-compose up bot`

And wait...
